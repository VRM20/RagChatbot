# 💰 Loan Approval Q\&A Bot

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that answers questions about a loan approval dataset using local language models and vector search. It combines document retrieval (via FAISS) with a lightweight open-source LLM to provide intelligent, offline-capable answers.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Document Retrieval**: Uses FAISS vector index to fetch relevant chunks from the dataset
* **Embeddings**: Locally hosted `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model
* **LLM**: Uses `flan-t5-large` (no API keys needed)
* **Streamlit UI**: Simple web app to ask questions interactively
* **Fallback Logic**: Answers simple math queries (e.g., max loan amount) using Pandas
* **Instruction-tuned**: System prompt makes the bot behave like a loan officer

---

## 🧠 Example Questions

* What is the maximum loan amount?
* What features are used to approve a loan?
* What does Credit\_History mean?
* How does ApplicantIncome affect approval?
